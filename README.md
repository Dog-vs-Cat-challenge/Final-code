# Final-code
These are our final code scripts for the MBZUAI Dog vs Cat challenge, 2021 <br>
We got the first position in the overall standing with our model accuracy of 99.56% on the evaluation test dataset. <br>
<br>
The repo includes:
<ol>
  <li> PyTorch Jupyter Notebook (we used it to train different SOTA models (ResNets, DenseNets, VGG-16 etc) </li>
  <li> fast.ai Jupyter Notebook for EfficientNet model experimentations (final results were submitted using the model trained on this Notebook) </li>
   <li> CSV file containing the predicted labels from our final efficient model which were used for submission ( EfficientNet B2 ) </li>
 </ol>
  
 ## Experimentation

 ## Summary: Cats vs Dogs Challenge
 
 ## Requirements 
We recommend using Google colab to run the code due to the complex computation. <br>
A GPU is recommended which is provided for free in colab. <br>
So you can directly re-run the notebooks using Google Collab
